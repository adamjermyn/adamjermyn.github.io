      <description>Notes I take notes to support reference, recollection, and accumulation. This approach was heavily influenced by Andy Matuschak&amp;rsquo;s concept of Evergreen Notes.
Reference The best reference for learning something is usually not the most useful for applying it. I learned about random walks from the Feynman Lectures, but when I need to calculate diffusion coefficients I reference a note that just gives the answer and a few supporting details.
Reference notes should be optimized for frequently, repeated use.</description>

      <description>Prioritization Picking the right ideas to work on is important.
I write ideas in Markdown notes with one top-level header per idea. To decide what to work on, I use a python script which asks me to compare ideas to one another. The comparison questions are:
 If both ideas work, what is their relative impact? What are the relative odds of the ideas working? How long will each idea take to implement?</description>

      <description>Feedback Getting things right without feedback is really hard, so getting frequent and meaningful feedback is important. I do this by asking others for feedback and by looking back at how past work has gone.
Asking Others Giving good feedback is hard. When I ask for feedback I try to make it easier by making it clear what I want feedback on, and by being as specific as possible. So feedback on specific projects or interactions is often better than feedback on &amp;ldquo;my job in general&amp;rdquo;.</description>
