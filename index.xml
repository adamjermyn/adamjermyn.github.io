      <title>Notes</title>

      <description>Notes I take notes to support reference, recollection, and accumulation. This approach was heavily influenced by Andy Matuschak&amp;rsquo;s concept of Evergreen Notes.
Reference The best reference for learning something is usually not the most useful for applying it. I learned about random walks from the Feynman Lectures, but when I need to calculate diffusion coefficients I reference a note that just gives the answer and a few supporting details.
Reference notes should be optimized for frequently, repeated use.</description>

      <title>Prioritization</title>

      <description>Prioritization Picking the right ideas to work on is important.
I write ideas in Markdown notes with one top-level header per idea. To decide what to work on, I use a python script which asks me to compare ideas to one another. The comparison questions are:
 If both ideas work, what is their relative impact? What are the relative odds of the ideas working? How long will each idea take to implement?</description>

      <title>Spaced Repetition</title>

      <description>Spaced Repetition Spaced repetition is a technique for remembering information over long time periods. It takes advantage of the empirical observation that the time it takes to forget a fact is proportional to the time that fact is known. This suggests that the best strategy to remember something indefinitely is to review facts with ever-larger (geometrically increasing) gaps between reviews. Following that strategy, a finite number of reviews is needed to remember something for the rest of your life, and that number is small enough that the study time needed to remember a fact indefinitely is about 5 minutes, so long as the studying happens in this spaced-out way.</description>

      <title>Examples of Tools with Values</title>
      <link>http://adamjermyn.com/posts/values_examples/</link>

      <description>I previously argued that tools should express values. Here are some examples of tools I&amp;rsquo;ve made with an eye to values.
A Brainstorming Environment I have a shell script that sets up a work environment for brainstorming. It does this by copying and opening a template text document that says the following:
# Session: - Maintain an attitude of suspended judgement. - You&#39;re here to climb out of the basin. - Cmd+E Will bring up an (incomplete) list of possible approaches.</description>

      <title>Growing Food on Mars</title>
      <link>http://adamjermyn.com/posts/mars_soil/</link>

      <description>Growing food on Mars is a critical component of making a self-sufficient city because shipping food is expensive.
Unfortunately it seems that Martian regolith is too alkaline and is missing key nutrients needed to grow crops. The alkaline issue can be solved by adding acid, which is both low-weight and can be produced locally if need be. The nutrient issue can be addressed either by adding organic material or by artificial nutrient supplementation.</description>

      <title>Early Martian Software</title>

      <description>Building a city on Mars will be very capital intensive because in the early stages it&amp;rsquo;s extremely expensive to sustain people on Mars. But capital is a vague term: what does this actually look like?
The last few attempts at a human presence in space primarily used physical capital: heavy machinery, giant rockets and space stations and industrial equipment. Mars will need all of that too. But the last few times were in the 1960s-90s, when computers were slow and software much more limited and expensive than today.</description>

      <title>Robust Tools</title>
      <link>http://adamjermyn.com/posts/robust_tools/</link>

      <description>Good tools are robust. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t just mean that they don&amp;rsquo;t fail, it means that in many instances they can&amp;rsquo;t fail. They take common failure modes off the table, freeing you to use them and focus on your goals.
Impossible Failure Modes For a robust tool many failure modes are, by design, simply impossible, to the point where it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine what those failure modes are.
Consider a solid metal hammer.</description>

      <title>Tools Should Express Values</title>
      <link>http://adamjermyn.com/posts/tools_values/</link>

      <guid>http://adamjermyn.com/posts/tools_values/</guid>
      <description>I want my tools to express values. I want my text editor to tell me to write clearly. I want my scientific software to command me “Be true, be open, be humble, be curious.” I want tools to be less blank pages and more pleas for me to honor the values of the craft.
Blank is not Neutral Many tools today are designed like blank pages. A writing app has a large blank space, with perhaps a few buttons for changing fonts and an indicator of how many words are on the page.</description>

      <title>Growth and Population on Mars</title>
      <link>http://adamjermyn.com/posts/alpha_beta/</link>

      <description>Economies of Scale I previously wrote about a simple model of an early Martain economy. A key input to that model is the way that human productivity scales with population and investment. I captured this with the simple scaling $$ p \propto I^\alpha n^\beta $$ for $\alpha,\beta &amp;gt; 0$. This relation says that the per-person productivity $p$ scales as some positive power $\alpha$ of the per-person investment $I$, which could reflect machinery or materials or personnel support from Earth, and as another positive power $\beta$ of the number of people $n$.</description>

      <title>An Economic Model of Martian Growth</title>

      <description>An Economic Model of Martian Growth Mars is an expensive place to live, but it rapidly becomes cheaper the more infrastructure it has! Because of that the total cost of building a self-sufficient city on Mars depends on how quickly infrastructure can be built. This is the key question I want to understand: what is the best way to invest in Martian infrastructure that minimizes the total cost?
A Simple Model To do this I&amp;rsquo;ll build a simple model of economic growth on Mars.</description>

      <title>Mass Scales for Living on Mars</title>

      <description>Mass Scales for Living on Mars Big thanks to Casey Handmer for reading and commenting on an early draft of this.
One of the most exciting things that may well happen this century is a sustained human presence on Mars. The main reason this is possible at all is that SpaceX has cut launch costs dramatically. Despite this progress, cargo sent from Earth and soft-landed on Mars is likely to be the primary resource constraint in the Martian economy for a very long time, so it is worth exploring the scale of cargo required to support a human presence, and what that translated into in dollars.</description>

      <title>Feedback</title>

      <guid>http://adamjermyn.com/workflow/feedback/</guid>
      <description>Feedback Getting things right without feedback is really hard, so getting frequent and meaningful feedback is important. I do this by asking others for feedback and by looking back at how past work has gone.
Asking Others Giving good feedback is hard. When I ask for feedback I try to make it easier by making it clear what I want feedback on, and by being as specific as possible. So feedback on specific projects or interactions is often better than feedback on &amp;ldquo;my job in general&amp;rdquo;.</description>
