      <description>(This is not medical advice. Co-written with Nicholas Schiefer. Thanks to Sylvia Hürlimann for helpful discussions and comments. Corrections welcome.)
What can a rapid test tell you? Omicron Edition This holiday season is also Omicron season. The Omicron variant dramatically increases COVID risk for basically everyone, especially with case counts exploding and doubling every two days in most northern areas (New York, Boston, London). Although Omicron seems to be less severe than other variants for most people, it&amp;rsquo;s probably worth some effort to protect high-risk individuals, especially while case rates are so high.</description>

      <title>Classifying Scientific Compute Workflows</title>
      <link>https://adamjermyn.com/posts/scientific_compute/</link>

      <description>Scientists use computers, and not just for typesetting. Lots of experimentation and discovery is done with computers, from modeling climate to predicting material properties to discovering exoplanets. Because computation is applied to such a broad range of questions, the ways it gets used are many and varied. This diversity of application means that tools developed and lessons learned in one domain of scientific compute workflow often don&amp;rsquo;t generalize to very different domains.</description>

      <description>(This is not investment advice.)
Stable coins are an important tool, allowing investors to trade ordinary (fiat) currencies on the blockchain, but they have a somewhat opaque risk structure. Usually either the coin tracks the desired currency or else the peg fails, in which case investors start withdrawing and the coin suddenly trades well below the peg.
What if there was a coin with a more transparent risk structure? What would that make possible?</description>

      <title>Practicing Agency</title>

      <description>Agency is where you act to achieve your goals. Unfortunately agency is hard and not the default state.
Social nudging is a powerful way to combat this. Here are a few lightly-edited conversations that I&amp;rsquo;ve observed or participated in that pushed towards more agency:
Fire  P1: There&amp;rsquo;s a fire ~20 miles away and it&amp;rsquo;s raining ash.
P2: Do you have an air purifier?
P1: &amp;hellip; no, I should get one.</description>

      <description>Abstract (This is not medical advice. I am not a medical professional. Thanks to Rose DiLoreto for the idea for this post.)
Supplementing with Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) seems probably helpful for headaches and migraines, likely reducing their frequency by about 50% as well as reducing severity somewhat. This is backed by multiple randomized controlled trials, and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to check for anything funny in those trials (small samples, weird controls, etc.</description>

You&amp;rsquo;re walking on the street, minding your business. Suddenly, a stranger (S) comes up and starts talking to you:
 S: Have you heard? There&amp;rsquo;s a one-in-a-million chance you could save a billion lives! All you have to do is found a crypto currency, become extremely rich, and use that money to fight Malaria!</description>

      <description>COVID Testing - Sensitivity and Timelines This past week a close contact had a potential COVID exposure, so I wanted to understand a few basic questions about COVID testing to help figure out what is safe and what isn&amp;rsquo;t. Three questions seem especially relevant:
 How sensitive are PCR and rapid antigen tests? If someone tests negative on a rapid antigen test but positive on PCR, should they worry about infecting other people?</description>

      <title>A School for Agency</title>

      <description>A School for Agency Agency is where you act to achieve your goals. It&amp;rsquo;s where you look at problems and say &amp;ldquo;How could I solve them?&amp;rdquo; and really think about that and arrive at possible courses of action and then take those actions. Explicitly, agency is about executing three steps:
 Notice a problem/question. Brainstorm solutions. Try solutions until something works or the costs exceed the benefits.  An example I return to often in the summer is air conditioning.</description>

      <title>Automated Project Reviews</title>

      <description>Automated Project Reviews Getting things right without feedback is really hard, but not all feedback comes from other people! One quick way to generate meaningful feedback is by looking back at past work.
A challenge with looking back is doing it at the right time. For some kinds of feedback this is easy: schedule weekly/monthly/quarterly reviews, with prompts tuned to the relevant time-scale. But some areas of life don&amp;rsquo;t run on a regular schedule.</description>

      <title>Toy Model of Near-Existential Risk</title>
      <link>https://adamjermyn.com/posts/near_existential_risk_pt2/</link>

      <guid>https://adamjermyn.com/posts/near_existential_risk_pt2/</guid>
      <description>I recently wrote about near-existential risk. These are risks which result in massive losses to society of people/technology/capability, but which themselves do not actually end or permanently curtail human existence. Here I want to build a toy model for thinking about these risks and how they relate to actual existential risks.
A Toy Model For these purposes I&amp;rsquo;m going to reduce the many dimensions of loss to a single parameter $\ell$.</description>

      <description>Longtermism is a moral theory that says that most of the value we (humans) ought to care about lies in the future, and so we should look hard for opportunities to influence the future in positive ways. Longtermism arises as a natural consequence of three ideas:
 Utilitarianism: We should improve the lives/subjective wellbeing of as many people as much as possible, evaluated by summing improvements over lives. Future lives are just as valuable as present lives.</description>

      <title>Examples of Tools with Values</title>

      <description>I previously argued that tools should express values. Here are some examples of tools I&amp;rsquo;ve made with an eye to values.
A Brainstorming Environment I have a shell script that sets up a work environment for brainstorming. It does this by copying and opening a template text document that says the following:
# Session: - Maintain an attitude of suspended judgement. - You&#39;re here to climb out of the basin. - Cmd+E Will bring up an (incomplete) list of possible approaches.</description>

      <title>Growing Food on Mars</title>
      <link>https://adamjermyn.com/posts/mars_soil/</link>

      <description>Growing food on Mars is a critical component of making a self-sufficient city because shipping food is expensive.
Unfortunately it seems that Martian regolith is too alkaline and is missing key nutrients needed to grow crops. The alkaline issue can be solved by adding acid, which is both low-weight and can be produced locally if need be. The nutrient issue can be addressed either by adding organic material or by artificial nutrient supplementation.</description>

      <title>Early Martian Software</title>

      <description>Building a city on Mars will be very capital intensive because in the early stages it&amp;rsquo;s extremely expensive to sustain people on Mars. But capital is a vague term: what does this actually look like?
The last few attempts at a human presence in space primarily used physical capital: heavy machinery, giant rockets and space stations and industrial equipment. Mars will need all of that too. But the last few times were in the 1960s-90s, when computers were slow and software much more limited and expensive than today.</description>

      <description>Good tools are robust. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t just mean that they don&amp;rsquo;t fail, it means that in many instances they can&amp;rsquo;t fail. They take common failure modes off the table, freeing you to use them and focus on your goals.
Impossible Failure Modes For a robust tool many failure modes are, by design, simply impossible, to the point where it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine what those failure modes are.
Consider a solid metal hammer.</description>

      <title>Tools Should Express Values</title>

      <description>I want my tools to express values. I want my text editor to tell me to write clearly. I want my scientific software to command me “Be true, be open, be humble, be curious.” I want tools to be less blank pages and more pleas for me to honor the values of the craft.
Blank is not Neutral Many tools today are designed like blank pages. A writing app has a large blank space, with perhaps a few buttons for changing fonts and an indicator of how many words are on the page.</description>

      <title>Growth and Population on Mars</title>
      <link>https://adamjermyn.com/posts/alpha_beta/</link>

      <description>Economies of Scale I previously wrote about a simple model of an early Martain economy. A key input to that model is the way that human productivity scales with population and investment. I captured this with the simple scaling $$ p \propto I^\alpha n^\beta $$ for $\alpha,\beta &amp;gt; 0$. This relation says that the per-person productivity $p$ scales as some positive power $\alpha$ of the per-person investment $I$, which could reflect machinery or materials or personnel support from Earth, and as another positive power $\beta$ of the number of people $n$.</description>

      <title>An Economic Model of Martian Growth</title>

      <description>An Economic Model of Martian Growth Mars is an expensive place to live, but it rapidly becomes cheaper the more infrastructure it has! Because of that the total cost of building a self-sufficient city on Mars depends on how quickly infrastructure can be built. This is the key question I want to understand: what is the best way to invest in Martian infrastructure that minimizes the total cost?
A Simple Model To do this I&amp;rsquo;ll build a simple model of economic growth on Mars.</description>

      <description>Mass Scales for Living on Mars Big thanks to Casey Handmer for reading and commenting on an early draft of this.
One of the most exciting things that may well happen this century is a sustained human presence on Mars. The main reason this is possible at all is that SpaceX has cut launch costs dramatically. Despite this progress, cargo sent from Earth and soft-landed on Mars is likely to be the primary resource constraint in the Martian economy for a very long time, so it is worth exploring the scale of cargo required to support a human presence, and what that translated into in dollars.</description>
