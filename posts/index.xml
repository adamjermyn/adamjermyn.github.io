      <description>An Economic Model of Martian Growth [Mars is an expensive place to live][mars_scales], but it rapidly becomes cheaper the [more infrastructure][https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2018/09/03/how-to-industrialize-mars/] it has! Because of that the total cost of building a self-sufficient city on Mars depends on how quickly infrastructure can be built. This is the key question I want to understand: what is the best way to invest in Martian infrastructure that minimizes the total cost?
A Simple Model To do this I&amp;rsquo;ll build a simple model of economic growth on Mars.</description>

      <description>Mass Scales for Living on Mars Big thanks to Casey Handmer for reading and commenting on an early draft of this.
One of the most exciting things that may well happen this century is a sustained human presence on Mars. The main reason this is possible at all is that SpaceX has cut launch costs dramatically. Despite this progress, cargo sent from Earth and soft-landed on Mars is likely to be the primary resource constraint in the Martian economy for a very long time, so it is worth exploring the scale of cargo required to support a human presence, and what that translated into in dollars.</description>
