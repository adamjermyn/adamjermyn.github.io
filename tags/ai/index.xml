      <description>Summary  Covered boilerplate for getting started, tensors, gradients. Poked in some detail at how gradients work. Played with linear regression, nonlinear regression, both with gradient descent. Built an MNIST classifier following a PyTorch tutorial. Experimented with the shape and size of the NN. Got PyTorch running on a machine with a GPU.  Boilerplate Import:
import torch Need to use a special float type for the elements of tensors, and need to know which device the compute graph will run on:</description>
