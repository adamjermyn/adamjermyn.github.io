      <description>This is a collection of some things I&amp;rsquo;ve found beautiful recently.
Recursive Game of Life (see the run-through here). Each cell is being simulated by another instance of the Game of Life, and if you zoom out enough you see that the structures you started off looking at are also simulations of cells.
