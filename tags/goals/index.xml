      <description>Projects begin with goals. At first these are implicit, but as a project takes shape it helps to state them explicitly. Stating goals serves two purposes: it defines success, and it prompts action.

 &amp;ldquo;Change the world.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Disrupt the industry.</description>
