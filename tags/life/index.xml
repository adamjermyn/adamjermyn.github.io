      <description>Ideas Looking back, it feels like there was often a &amp;lsquo;right time&amp;rsquo; for me to encounter particular ideas:
 I encountered a lot of ideas from religion very young (as many people do). I was also very interested in science, and so got hung up on factual disagreements rather than seeing e.g. the point of having a dedicated day of rest. I came across the Feynman Lectures in high school, when I knew just enough math that it was possible to work through them, but not enough math or physics that it felt like review.</description>
