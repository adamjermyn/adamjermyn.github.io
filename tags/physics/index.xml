      <description>I recently collaborated with Claude Opus 4.5 to write a short set of lecture notes on fracture mechanics:
Lectures on Fractures (PDF)
How it worked I wanted something in Feynman&amp;rsquo;s style. Conversational, building intuition before formalism, full of physical insight. So I had Claude start by reading some of Feynman&amp;rsquo;s writing and assembling a style guide. That gave us a shared reference for tone.
The technical focus was Griffith&amp;rsquo;s work on fractures.</description>

      <description>I sometimes have research ideas that I think are cool, but that don’t make sense for me to pursue. I generally just make a note of them and move on. This is the 22nd post in a series describing some of the ideas I’ve accumulated. This idea is closely related to conversations I&amp;rsquo;ve had over the years to with George Varnavides.
Waves in electron hydrodynamics What&amp;rsquo;s the idea? In some materials, electron scattering is momentum-conserving (on some relevant length- and time-scale).</description>

      <title>#SAT with Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>Cross-posted from LessWrong.
(Thanks to Mark Xu for comments on these notes.)
These are some notes on tensor networks, the mapping from boolean circuits to tensor networks, and how #SAT can be written as a tensor network contraction.
Definitions and Notation What is a tensor? A rank-$d$ tensor is an array of numbers with $d$ integer indices, e.g. $T_{ijk}$ is a rank-3 tensor. The range of each index is called its bond dimension.</description>
