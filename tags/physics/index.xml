(Thanks to Mark Xu for comments on these notes.)
These are some notes on tensor networks, the mapping from boolean circuits to tensor networks, and how #SAT can be written as a tensor network contraction.
Definitions and Notation What is a tensor? A rank-$d$ tensor is an array of numbers with $d$ integer indices, e.g. $T_{ijk}$ is a rank-3 tensor. The range of each index is called its bond dimension.</description>
