      <description>I just skimmed through Oliver Wendell Holmes&amp;rsquo;s The Path of Law. A few things that stood out:
 He frames the law as a field of study with the aim of predicting the decisions of course. I think he’s trying to disentangle the law from a statement of morals. It’s not about what is right, it’s a practical question of what rules you will actually be held to account on and how that account will appear.</description>
