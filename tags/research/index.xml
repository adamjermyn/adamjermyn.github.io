      <title>Give the AI safe tools</title>

      <description>(Cross-posted from LessWrong)
One kind of concern with AI is that:
 There are some tools that are instrumentally useful for an AI to have. Most/the most accessible versions of those tools are dangerous. The AI doesn’t care which versions are dangerous. Hence, the AI will probably develop dangerous tools for instrumental reasons.  You might call concerns like this Instrumental Danger Problems. This post aims to examine some existing approaches to Instrumental Danger Problems, and to introduce a new one, namely “Giving the AI safe tools”.</description>

      <title>Does the core convective dipole align with rotation?</title>

      <description>I sometimes have research ideas that I think are cool, but that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense for me to pursue. I generally just make a note of them and move on. This is the ninth post in a series describing some of the ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated.
Does the core convective dipole align with rotation? What&amp;rsquo;s the idea? I&amp;rsquo;m struggling to find a reference, but a recent result out of convection simulations in fully spherical domains is that the dominant flow pattern is a dipole (e.</description>

      <title>Do pulsating stars reveal inhibited convection?</title>

      <description>I sometimes have research ideas that I think are cool, but that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense for me to pursue. I generally just make a note of them and move on. This is the eighth post in a series describing some of the ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated.
Do pulsating stars reveal inhibited convection? What&amp;rsquo;s the idea? Many A/B stars have pulsations driven by the $\kappa$-mechanism. In these stars, the pulsation often interacts with near-surface convective layers, motivating tools like time-dependent convection theories.</description>

      <description>I sometimes have research ideas that I think are cool, but that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense for me to pursue. I generally just make a note of them and move on. This is the seventh post in a series describing some of the ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated.
Lensing from compact remnants in the Galactic Center What&amp;rsquo;s the idea? It&amp;rsquo;s thought that the Milky Way used to host an AGN disk. AGN disks likely contain many stars, and those stars very preferentially evolve into black holes.</description>

Theoretical limits on extreme baseline optical interferometry What&amp;rsquo;s the idea? Interferometry let&amp;rsquo;s you build a giant &amp;lsquo;virtual telescope&amp;rsquo; out of lots of small telescopes. The effective baseline is the longest distance between telescopes, and the number of pixels of effective resolution is roughly the number of telescopes.</description>

      <title>Does the Parker mechanism spin down AGN stars?</title>

      <description>I sometimes have research ideas that I think are cool, but that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense for me to pursue. I generally just make a note of them and move on. This is the fifth post in a series describing some of the ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated.
Does the Parker mechanism spin down AGN stars? What&amp;rsquo;s the idea? Collaborators and I previously predicted that stars embedded in AGN disks should end up spinning really fast (near breakup).</description>

      <description>I sometimes have research ideas that I think are cool, but that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense for me to pursue. I generally just make a note of them and move on. This is the fourth post in a series describing some of the ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated.
How correlated are the positions of stars? What&amp;rsquo;s the idea? Thanks to the Gaia mission, we now have accurate 3D positions for a large number of stars in the galaxies.</description>

Can an ad-hoc electron binding model fix the low-temperature low-density limit of the Skye EOS? What&amp;rsquo;s the idea? The reason that the Skye EOS doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover all temperatures and densities is that it assumes fully ionized matter, which breaks down at low temperatures.</description>

Can planet injestion explain magnetic RGB stars? What&amp;rsquo;s the idea? There are some very magnetic Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars, with measured internal fields of order $10^{5-7}\mathrm{G}$.</description>

      <description>I sometimes have research ideas that I think are cool, but that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense for me to pursue. I generally just make a note of them and move on. Over the next few months I&amp;rsquo;ll be collecting those notes and posting those ideas here.
The format I&amp;rsquo;ll try to follow is to explain:
 What the idea is. Why I think it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting idea. How I think someone interested in working on the idea could get started.</description>

      <title>Chaos in Stellar Evolution</title>

      <description>Are stars predictable or chaotic?
A system is chaotic if small perturbations grow exponentially with time. This makes chaotic systems unpredictable on long time-scales, because it becomes fine details in the starting conditions come to dominate at long times.
So: are stars predictable or chaotic? As far as I know this is an open question.
There is some sense in which most stars are predictable. They exist near thermal and hydrostatic equilibrium, and they tend to return to equilibrium when perturbed.</description>
