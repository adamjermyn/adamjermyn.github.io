      <description>There is a fourth kind of rest I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention: Inactivity. All the other kinds of rest, Distraction, Recreation, and Maintenance, are active. They involve doing something. That something might not be productive in any traditional sense, but it&amp;rsquo;s an active choice to do something rather than nothing.
Inactivity is different. Inactivity is choosing to do nothing. It&amp;rsquo;s sitting on a couch being bored, letting thoughts come and go but not pursuing them.</description>

      <description>Rest is important, but what is it?
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed three kinds of activities people call rest:
 Maintenance Distraction Recreation  Many activities could fall into any of these categories, and the distinction I want to draw is all about the motivation.
Maintenance is what you do to keep life going. Think of cooking, cleaning, sleep, hygiene, sorting through mail, etc. These activities are both necessary and often get pushed to the wayside during a busy work week, so they&amp;rsquo;re natural to reach for in down time.</description>
