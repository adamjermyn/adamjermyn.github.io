      <description>Taxes create incentives. When the government tax an activity, society does less of it. Tax alcohol, people drink less. Tax smoking, people smoke less. Tax income, people work less. Tax investment, people invest less. I&amp;rsquo;m going to take this as given for now, even though there are many caveats on all of these statements.
This suggests a simple principle for crafting a tax code: tax the things we want less of, and don&amp;rsquo;t tax the things we want more of.</description>
