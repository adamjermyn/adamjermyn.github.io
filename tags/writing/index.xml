      <description>I recently collaborated with Claude Opus 4.5 to write a short set of lecture notes on fracture mechanics:
Lectures on Fractures (PDF)
How it worked I wanted something in Feynman&amp;rsquo;s style. Conversational, building intuition before formalism, full of physical insight. So I had Claude start by reading some of Feynman&amp;rsquo;s writing and assembling a style guide. That gave us a shared reference for tone.
The technical focus was Griffith&amp;rsquo;s work on fractures.</description>
