                    <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>Tools should make work easier, more effective, and more fun.</p>
<p>This is an incomplete list of the tools I use, along with commentary on why I use them.</p>
<h3 id="computersos">Computers/OS</h3>
<p>To help with work/life balance I use two computers, one for work and one for everything else. Both are Macbook Pro&rsquo;s running macOS, one is 15&quot; (work) and the other is 16&quot; (other).</p>
<p>I often run calculations on remote machines which I don&rsquo;t manage. Those almost always run some variant of <a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a> Linux.</p>
<h3 id="phonetablet">Phone/Tablet</h3>
<p>I use an iPhone as my primary handheld device, along with an Apple Watch and iPad Pro (12.9&quot;). Because I look at my phone often, and because <a href="https://adamjermyn.com/posts/tools_values/">Tools Should Express Values</a> I use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widgetsmith/id1523682319">Widgetsmith</a> app to produce widgets that just feature text reminding me of values I under-use, and these live on my home screen.</p>
<h3 id="scheduling-and-task-management">Scheduling and Task Management</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a> for calendar management on iOS and iCal on macOS. I find Fantastical provides a more information-rich display on a small screen, whereas iCal is cleaner to look at on the big screen.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> on both macOS and iOS for tracking todos. I like the look and feel of Things, and it is powerful enough for most of what I want to do, including recurring tasks. I also make daily task lists in markdown files to ensure I make a conscious decision of what I want to accomplish each day.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.dueapp.com">Due</a> for tasks that I have to do by a particular time. It&rsquo;s great at reminding me over and over when that time comes, in a way that&rsquo;s much harder to ignore than either a calendar event or a Things todo.</p>
<h3 id="automationsearch">Automation/Search</h3>
<p>I automate tasks on my Mac using <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>. I also use Alfred to search documents and folders.</p>
<p>Alfred supports <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/">Workflows</a>, which are a powerful way to build automated tasks. For instance I have a workflow (activated with the command <code>nlog</code>) that creates a time-stampted markdown file in a &ldquo;Research Log&rdquo; folder, populates it with a template, and opens it. I have similar workflows for my <a href="https://adamjermyn.com/workflow/feedback/">Weekly Reviews</a> which further open the previous week&rsquo;s prospective and review.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>I write <a href="https://adamjermyn.com/workflow/notes/">notes</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> with MathTeX using <a href="https://typora.io">Typora</a>. Typora is by far my favorite Markdown editor. It provides inline previews as I type, supports beautiful formatting themes (I use <a href="https://theme.typora.io/theme/Misty/">Mysty Light</a>), has a fast-feeling interface, and provides a minimal integrated file browser in the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="pen-and-paper">Pen-and-Paper</h3>
<p>In 2019 I switched from using pen-and-paper for calculations to using an iPad Pro with a 2nd generation Apple Pencil, and I haven&rsquo;t looked back. I tried the previous generation pencil and found it too cumbersome to use regularly, but the new ones (especially with &lsquo;double tap for eraser&rsquo;) feel strictly better than pen-and-paper.</p>
<h3 id="analytic-calculations">Analytic Calculations</h3>
<p>I mostly do analytic calculations with pen-and-paper or equivalent. I use <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> for more complicated expressions and more investigation-style work (plotting, inspecting expressions, etc.).</p>
<h3 id="emailcollaboration">Email/Collaboration</h3>
<p>I use <a href="gmail.com">Gmail</a> to host my email and access it with the <a href="https://superhuman.com">Superhuman</a> client. Superhuman has the best filtering tools I&rsquo;ve seen, the most easy-to-remember keyboard shortcuts, works offline, and the interface is <strong>fast</strong>. Interface speed is underrated and they&rsquo;re among the best.</p>
<p>For more interactive collaboration I use <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>, <a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a>, and <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a>. I prefer Zoom over Skype because I find it easier to use, especially for sharing a tablet&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<h3 id="software-development">Software Development</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had trouble using sophisticated IDE&rsquo;s. I usually find their interfaces clunky and/or slow.</p>
<p>I edit code with <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>. I use <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> for version control and <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> for hosting repositories (including this website!). I find it difficult to work with Git in the command line, so I use the <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/mac">Tower</a> graphical Git client.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.anaconda.com">Anaconda</a> to manage my Python environment. I&rsquo;ve found this more robust than manual management with pip.</p>
<h3 id="presentationsgraphics">Presentations/Graphics</h3>
<p>I make presentations and schematic figures in <a href="https://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint">Powerpoint</a>.</p>
<h3 id="utilities">Utilities</h3>
<p>I use <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net">zsh</a> with <a href="https://ohmyz.sh">oh-my-zsh</a> for my shell. The most useful feature for me is the ability to search for matching history commands with the up arrow.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://the.exa.website">exa</a> as a replacement for <code>ls</code>. By default it shows the information I want, and it shows it with pretty colors. I suspect I could configure <code>ls</code> to do the same, but this was easier.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> as a replacement for <code>cat</code> because it provides line numbering and syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/bootandy/dust">dust</a> as a replacement for <code>du</code> because I find it faster and it defaults to more human-readable output.</p>
<h3 id="simulationsnumerical-calculations">Simulations/Numerical Calculations</h3>
<p>I manage remote simulations using my <a href="https://github.com/adamjermyn/remote_experiments">RemoteExperiments</a> Python package because I frequently want to perform reproducible numerical experiments and managing them all by hand became difficult.</p>
<p>I simulate stellar evolution using <a href="https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/">Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)</a> because it is open source, it&rsquo;s the code I have the most experience with, and it&rsquo;s a code I help develop.</p>
<p>I perform Bayesian inference using <a href="https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">dynesty</a> because I like its Python interface and the way it sets up inference problems in terms of likelihoods and priors meshes with how I think about them. I also like the fact that the underlying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_sampling_algorithm">Nested Sampling</a> method provides estimates of both the likelihood and the uncertainty in the likelihood.</p>
<h3 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a> for <a href="https://adamjermyn.com/workflow/spacedrepetition/">spaced repetition</a>. It came highly reviewed by <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Michael Nielsen</a>. That said, I&rsquo;m actively looking for alternatives because I&rsquo;ve run into limitations with Anki. In particular, inspired by <a href="https://andymatuschak.org">Andy Matuschak</a>, I would like to be able to queue tasks with spaced repetition, and Anki is not well set-up for that. I also want to be able to mark cards as &lsquo;bad&rsquo; (meaning &lsquo;refactor this card&rsquo;), but haven&rsquo;t found an easy way to do this in Anki.</p>
<p>I mostly <strong>review</strong> cards using Anki on iOS and <strong>create</strong> cards using Anki on macOS.</p>
<h3 id="habitshealth">Habits/Health</h3>
<p>I track habits using <a href="https://wayoflifeapp.com">Way of Life</a>. I picked this because it doesn&rsquo;t try to impose its own goals on my habits, and it lets me easily see my progress on each habit through the week.</p>
<p>On Way of Life I only track whether or not I performed a habit each day. I separately track details of exercise-related habits using my Apple Watch as well as the <a href="http://www.fitlist.com">fitlist</a> app on iOS, which I found provided an easy-albeit-clunky way to enter, review, and export data.</p>
<p>Until the end of 2020 I tracked my eating habits with <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com">MyFitnessPal</a>. In 2021 I switched to <a href="https://foodnoms.com">FoodNoms</a>. I found FoodNoms provided quicker data entry, and provides more useful feedback and reports on my habits. A downside of FoodNoms is that its food database is much less extensive than that of MyFitnessPal, so I end up having to think of similar foods or decomposing foods into ingredients more often. I&rsquo;ve been tracking my eating for years so I&rsquo;m pretty good at that, but it would give me pause in recommending FoodNoms to someone just starting out on tracking food.</p>
<p>I meditate with a combination of <a href="https://www.headspace.com">Headspace</a> and <a href="https://wakingup.com">Waking Up</a>. Headspace gives a more &lsquo;standard&rsquo; experience whereas Waking Up provides a broader diversity of guided meditations. Because of that I would recommend starting with Headspace and using Waking Up as a supplement later on.</p>
